** Setting the Theme
So the doom themes may be great and all, but none of them match perfectly with how I set the colors in my set up, based around (and literally copied and pasted) from ChrisAtMachine. So, I decided, I should just bring his Lunar theme to Emacs.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package doom-themes)
(setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
      doom-themes-enable-italic t)
(load-theme 'lunar t)
#+end_src

** Transparency
#+begin_src elisp
;; (defvar efs/frame-transparency '(85 . 85))
;; (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha efs/frame-transparency)
;; (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist `(alpha . ,efs/frame-transparency))
#+end_src

** More Language Support
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package haskell-mode)
#+end_src

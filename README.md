# Dotfiles

Welcome to the undeniably _mind blowing_ list of my _relevant_ dotfiles. Its your choice if you want to steal something, so go ahead. Just make sure you backup your system before you do since something might break.

## Keep in mind...

- All of my dotfiles were created and used on [Arch Linux.](https://archlinux.org/ "The Arch Linux Website")
- Create a backup or snapshot of your system before copying stuff over. Things might break and you may not be able to boot up your computer. This is being said from my past experince with different systems.
- I can not guarentee anything will work, so unless a problem is bothering me as well, I will not try to fix a bug in my configurations.

# Dotfiles

This repository holds all of my relative configurations for certain peices of software that I use daily. Everything you see here, are bits and pieces of stackoverflow, other people's dotfiles, and days worth of agony to try and get things working. You are free to take anything you want from here.

## Main Software

- XMonad (my tiling window manager) {DistroTube intensifies}
- Zsh   (my shell)
- Starship (my prompt) {DistroTube intensifies}
- Kitty (my terminal)
- Polybar (the bar of bars)
- Rofi (run launcher)
- Neovim (my text editor)

Notice: All commits that are labeled unverified are were actually done by me. I had been messing around with my GPG keys and thought that if i deleted it, everything would still be verified as me. The reason is i had changed systems and didnt actaually record the key and thought i could just replace it.

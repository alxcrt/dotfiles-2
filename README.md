# Dotfiles

This repository holds all of my relative configurations for certain peices of software that I use daily. Everything you see here, are bits and pieces of stackoverflow, other people's dotfiles, and days worth of agony to try and get things working. You are free to take anything you want from here.

## Main Software

- XMonad (my tiling window manager) {DistroTube intensifies}
- Zsh   (my shell)
- Starship (my prompt) {DistroTube intensifies}
- Kitty (my terminal)
- Polybar (the bar of bars)
- Rofi (run launcher)
- Neovim (my text editor)

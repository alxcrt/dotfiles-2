# Dependencies

There are not many dependencies required, as I just `git clone` plugins into my plugin folder. But the following can not be just copy and pasted:

```
zsh-completions-git (or zsh-completions)
starship (prompt)
```

Starship my main prompt. If you are against it, go into my `theme.zsh` and follow the instructions.

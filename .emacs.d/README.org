* My Emacs Config
This is my .emacs.d. The reason I switched from neovim to emacs is purely because of org mode. It is by far the killer feature of this program in my opinion!

* TODO Fix Errors
- [ ] Fix centaur tabs color error
- [ ] Dashboard bottom-line icon

* TODO Add Features
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Org Agenda
- [ ] Projectile project management
- [ ] Some sort of file tree
- [ ] Magit
- [ ] Email client

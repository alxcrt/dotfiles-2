#+DESCRIPTION: Activating and configuring org mode

** Requiring Org Mode
How on earth would I configure it otherwise.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org)
#+end_src

** Configuring Org
Copied and pasted from DT's config again but I think these are some sane defaults.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode)
(setq org-directory "~/Org/"
      org-agenda-files '("~/Org/agenda.org")
      org-default-notes-file (expand-file-name "notes.org" org-directory)
      org-ellipsis " â–¼ "
      org-log-done 'time
      org-journal-dir "~/Org/journal/"
      org-journal-date-format "%B %d, %Y (%A) "
      org-journal-file-format "%d-%m-%Y.org"
      org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
#+end_src

** Indentation
Makes things easier in life. Plus, I don't need to unindent to the start of the line to create a new heading.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation nil
      org-src-tab-acts-natively t
      org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+end_src

** Source Code Block Syntax Highlighting
Mainly for aesthetic purposes.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t
    org-src-tab-acts-natively t
    org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil
    org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+end_src

** Source Code Block Tag Expansion
I actually wrote this entire .emacs.d directory in Doom Emacs (without knowing if anything works) and without the '<s' then pressing tab shortcut, I would have gone through a lot of copying and pasting. So, I went back to DT.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-tempo
  :ensure nil) ;; tell use-package not to try to install org-tempo since it's already there.
#+end_src

** No Blank Lines
DT had it so I am adding it as well. Not really sure what difference it makes though.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-blank-before-new-entry (quote ((heading . nil)
                                         (plain-list-item . nil))))
#+end_src

** Enabling Org Bullets
Instead of disgusting looking asterisks, we get these weird UTF-8 characters to make the file look better. Also DT inspired.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-bullets)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))
#+end_src
